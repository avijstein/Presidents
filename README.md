# Presidents
Exploring data about the presidents. I found a cool visualization on [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful), and wanted to see if I could find out anything else with the same data.

This is also a first foray into RMarkdown, etc, so it is a little rudimentary, but a great learning experience.
